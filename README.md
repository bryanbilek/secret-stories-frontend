This is the frontend for an app that allows people to create an account & share their secret stories. The stack for this project includes: JavaScript & React for the creation of the app as well as styled-components & CSS to style it. Note: If you try to register or login it can take up to 30-60 seconds at first. I'm using a different site other than Heroku to host my API which seems to be a bit slower than Heroku was.
